## About Project

The project is written using the Laravel php framework.
This project is based on combining the skills developed on Model, Controller, Migrate.
The operation takes place through a connection to the assigned DB, and a "trains" table is created for it, which contains all the columns created by me through the migrates.
Once the columns have been initialized, in the "HomeController" we are going to set the where to receive only the trains departing for today from the DB.
